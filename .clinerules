# Cline Rules

- Using a markdown file named .clinelog.md log every change you make. Include a summary and a list of files you changed for each log entry. If the file does not exist, create it and add it to .gitignore.
- Use the following format for the log entry:

``` markdown
## [Date] [Time]
[Summary]

### Files Changed
- [File 1] - Brief description of changes
- [File 2] - Brief description of changes
- [File 3] - Brief description of changes
```

- After every task, update the README.md file for the project. If one does not exist, create it.
- After every task, update unit tests to cover the new functionality. Maintain 100% coverage.
- After every task, run the tests to ensure they pass. Fix any errors you find.
- Use debug statements in the function source and function test to fix errors and failed tests. Always remove debug statements when all tests pass.
- After 5 attempts to resolve the same issue, perform a brave search to get more information
- If the information in your memory or thinking is older than 2024, perform a brave search to get more information
