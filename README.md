# AI Coding Rules

A repo of files to be used with various AI coding assistants/agents. These are just a running list of the ones I use. If you want to contribute, feel free. As I use more, I will add them.

* NOTE: I will not include any rules files that already exist in other repos. For example, if you use Aider, you can find the .aiderrules template in their repo.
